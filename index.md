## Projects:

During my studies I had the opportunity to work on a opensource project called Libslirp. The goal of the project was to learn about fuzzing and then pursuing the implementation of the fuzzers for Libslirp under Samuel Thibault.

## Challenges:

I really enjoy working on the app-system challenges.
