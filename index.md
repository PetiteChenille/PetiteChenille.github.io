During my studies I had the opportunity to work on a opensource project called Libslirp. The goal of the project was to learn about fuzzing and then pursuing the implementation of the fuzzers for Libslirp under Samuel Thibault.

## Challenges:

I really enjoy working on the app-system challenges.

I’m passionate about exploring new places and cultures. I love learning new languages which is why I chose to enroll in an International Track Bachelor allowing me to participate in a student exchange in Incheon, Korea.
